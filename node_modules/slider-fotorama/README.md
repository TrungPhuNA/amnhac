# Fotorama Slider

The original [fotorama repository](https://github.com/artpolikarpov/fotorama) has not been mantained since 2015.

This repository has 3 main goals:

- Apply pull requests from the original repository
- Rewrite the code with ES6
- Add new features

## Build source

Will rewrite the contents from `dist/`

## Development build

Will rewrite the contents from `dist/`, but without minification.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

## Run tests

Will run `jshint` and rebuild the test html files on `test/`

```sh

```
